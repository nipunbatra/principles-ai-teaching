# Introduction to Machine Learning

## AI in Action: Videos & Demonstrations

**Nipun Batra** | IIT Gandhinagar

---

<!--
NOTE: This lecture uses slides.pdf which contains embedded YouTube videos
demonstrating ML applications across domains:

- Protein folding (AlphaFold)
- Matrix multiplication (AlphaTensor)
- Code generation (Codex, Copilot)
- Weather prediction (GraphCast)
- Disaster response
- Energy systems
- Agriculture
- Healthcare
- Education
- Materials science
- Creative AI
- Self-driving cars

Plus: ML gone wrong examples (bias, deepfakes, adversarial attacks)
And: Formal ML definitions (Arthur Samuel, Tom Mitchell)

# This Lecture: Videos + Discussion

**Format:** Watch videos, discuss, reflect

**Goal:** See the breadth of what ML can do today

**Materials:** `slides.pdf` (video-based presentation)

# ML Applications We'll Explore

| Domain | Example | Video |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Biology** | AlphaFold protein structure | DeepMind |
| **Math** | Faster matrix multiplication | AlphaTensor |
| **Code** | AI pair programming | GitHub Copilot |
| **Weather** | 10-day forecasts | GraphCast |
| **Health** | Medical diagnosis | Various |
| **Creativity** | Art, music, writing | DALL-E, Suno |

# ML Gone Wrong

We'll also discuss:

- **Bias in ML systems** (hiring, justice, healthcare)
- **Deepfakes** and misinformation
- **Adversarial attacks** on ML models

Understanding limitations is as important as understanding capabilities.

# What is Machine Learning?

**Arthur Samuel (1959):**
> "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

**Tom Mitchell (1997):**
> "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to task T and performance measure P, if its performance at T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

# The Task-Performance-Experience Framework

| Component | Question | Example (Spam Filter) |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| **Task (T)** | What are we trying to do? | Classify emails as spam/not spam |
| **Performance (P)** | How do we measure success? | % of emails correctly classified |
| **Experience (E)** | What data do we learn from? | Database of labeled emails |

# Key Insight

Traditional Programming:
```
Human writes RULES → Computer follows rules → Output
```

Machine Learning:
```
Human provides DATA → Computer discovers rules → Output
```

<div class="insight">
The shift: Instead of programming rules, we program the learning process.
